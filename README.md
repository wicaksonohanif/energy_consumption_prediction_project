# ⚡ Analysis and Prediction of Energy Consumption in Buildings Using Ridge, Lasso, and Elastic Net Regression Algorithms.

## 🔎 About
This project focuses on the Analysis and Prediction of Energy Consumption in Buildings using advanced regression techniques. By applying Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, and Elastic Net Regression, the study aims to identify key factors influencing energy usage and build predictive models for better efficiency and sustainability. This project was created for the Forum Group Discussion held by Asisten MK Praktikum Unggulan DGX 2024/2025.

## ✨ Features
- [v] Energy consumption prediction (kWh) based on building type, square footage, number of occupants, appliances used, average temperature, and day of week.
- [v] Prediction model selector (Lasso, Ridge, and Elasticnet).
- [v] Each model evaluation and comparison.
